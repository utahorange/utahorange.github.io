Hi, Iâ€™m a computer science major at UCLA. Right now, I'm mostly interested in performance and security for systems, whether that be distributed ML or embedded.

This summer, I'm working on flight software at UCLA's [ELFIN Lab](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/)!

In my off-time I enjoy reading, watching movies, and rock climbing.
