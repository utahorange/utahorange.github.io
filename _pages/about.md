Hi, Iâ€™m a computer science major at UCLA. Right now, I'm mostly interested in performance and security for systems, whether that be distributed ML or embedded!

At the moment, I'm:
- a Flight Software Engineer at UCLA's [ELFIN Lab](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/)
- a SWE intern at [Strong Crypto](https://strongcrypto.com/)
- trying to learn whatever I can on the side!

In my off-time I enjoy reading, watching movies, and rock climbing.
