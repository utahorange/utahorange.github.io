Iâ€™m currently a computer science major at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). My interests are mostly in performance and security for systems, whether that be distributed ML or embedded.

This summer, I worked at UCLA's [ELFIN Lab](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/) and wrote a [filesystem](https://utahorange.github.io/blog/2025/filesystem/) that flew on a NASA-funded weather balloon. This quarter I'm focusing on redesigning our commanding architecture and data pipeline to be more performant and extensible for future CubeSat missions.

I'm also working on projects with big tech like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for the greater UCLA community as a member of [Bruin AI](https://bruinai.org/). 

In my free time I like to read, watch movies, and daydream about going rock climbing. Feel free to reach out at my email.
